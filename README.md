## Hello 👋 Welcome to my GitHub page! 

✨ My name is Liliane and I am a bioinformatician 💻 from Brazil 🇧🇷!
\
\
I am passionate about uncovering microbiomes 🦠 and their intricate associations with health 💖, diet 🥗, lifestyles 🗓️, and the environment 🌍.
\
\
My journey into the world of microbiomes began 10 years ago and since then, I have dedicated myself to exploring the complex microbial communities of:

- Fatal patients with unknown etiologies
- Amazonian Indigenous groups
- Healthy individuals across different lifestyles
- Ruminants with economic and environmental impacts
